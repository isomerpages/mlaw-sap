Mr Wong Kok Weng was appointed the Chief Public Defender in December 2022. He oversees the Public Defender’s Office, which provides criminal defence aid for persons with limited means facing non-capital criminal charges.

Mr Wong served as a Magistrate at the then-Subordinate Courts from 1988 to 1991, and as a legal counsel at the Ministry of Defence from 1991 to 2000. From 2000 to 2022, he was a Deputy Public Prosecutor in the Crime Division of the Attorney-General’s Chambers. As a Senior Director, he led a team prosecuting diverse criminal offences.

In 2013, Mr Wong also chaired an inter-agency committee that looked into providing support for accused persons with mental disorders or intellectual disabilities during the criminal investigation process. The committee’s findings led to the introduction of the Appropriate Adult Scheme in 2015. This scheme was extended to young suspects in 2017. Mr Wong continues to chair the committee overseeing both schemes.

Mr Wong obtained the Public Administration Medal (Bronze) in 1999 and the Long Service Award for 35 years of service in 2021.
