The Sentencing Advisory Panel comprises members from the Judiciary, the Ministry of Law, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Singapore Police Force, the Attorney-General’s Chambers, and the Bar. Its objective is to promote greater consistency, transparency and public awareness in sentencing.

The Panel formulates and publishes guidelines on matters relating to sentencing. The guidelines provide greater clarity about possible sentencing outcomes and the relevant sentencing factors.

The Panel facilitates a more holistic and consultative approach to sentencing, by bringing together
members with a wide range of experience and expertise in a single committee, which may also conduct research or consult relevant stakeholders, where appropriate.

The Panel’s guidelines may be cited by the Prosecution or the Defence in their arguments before the Courts. The Courts may decide whether to adopt the guidelines in a given case, and if so, how the guidelines should be applied. The guidelines are not legally binding on any Court, including one presided over by a member of the Panel. Members from the Judiciary participate in the Panel in a non-judicial capacity.

The Panel is supported by a Secretariat, which acts on the Panel’s instructions.
