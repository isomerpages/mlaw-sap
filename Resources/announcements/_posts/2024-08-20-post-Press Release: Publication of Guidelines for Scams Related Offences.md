<p>The inter-agency Sentencing Advisory Panel (“<strong>Panel</strong>”)
has published the Guidelines for Scams-Related Offences (“<strong>the Guidelines</strong>”).
<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>Parties may raise the Guidelines in their submissions to the court
with immediate effect.</p>
<h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>
<p>Scams are a major and fast-growing concern:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past five years,
the number of reported scam cases increased by more than seven-fold, while
the amounts lost to scams have quadrupled. In 2023, there were 46,563 scam
cases, an increase of 46.8% from 2022.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total amount of monies
lost by scam victims in 2023 alone was $651.8 million.</p>
<p>To combat the growing menace posed by scams, Parliament introduced new
offences under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes
(Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992 (“<strong>CDSA</strong>”) and Computer
Misuse Act 1993 (“<strong>CMA</strong>”) in 2023.<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a> The new CDSA and CMA offences target a critical component
of the operation of scam syndicates – persons in Singapore who hand over
control of their bank accounts or who disclose Singpass credentials to
others, who are then able to use these accounts and credentials to commit
scams and launder scam proceeds.</p>
<h4><strong>Guidelines</strong></h4>
<p>The Guidelines aim to provide clarity on how the new CDSA and CMA offences
should be sentenced. To send a strong deterrent signal, the Guidelines
recommend that significant imprisonment sentences should be the norm for
scams-related offences involving the handing over of bank accounts or the
disclosure of Singpass credentials. This recommendation applies to all
offenders (even young offenders below the age of 21), except juvenile offenders
dealt with in the Youth Court.</p>
<p>The Guidelines propose the following starting sentences for such scams-related
offences:</p>

<p>The Guidelines also recommend that the sentence may be further enhanced
if there are aggravating factors, such as if a vulnerable victim was involved,
if significant amounts of $100,000 or more had passed through the account
after it had been handed over, or if the offender was motivated by gain.</p>
<p>In particular, for cases involving vulnerable victims, such as those who
are elderly or unable to protect themselves due to physical or mental infirmity,
significant enhancements of at least 25% of the starting sentence are recommended.
This is to recognise the devastating impact that scams have on vulnerable
victims.</p>
