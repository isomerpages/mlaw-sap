<p>The Sentencing Advisory Panel has published the Guidelines for Scams-Related
Offences (“<strong>the Guidelines</strong>”). Parties may raise the Guidelines
in their submissions to the court with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Scams are a major and fast-growing concern:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Over the past five years, the number of reported scam cases increased
by more than seven-fold, while the amounts lost to scams have quadrupled.
In 2023, there were 46,563 scam cases, an increase of 46.8% from 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total amount of monies lost by scam victims in 2023 alone was $651.8
million.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>To combat the growing menace posed by scams, Parliament introduced new
offences under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes
(Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992 (“<strong>CDSA</strong>”) and Computer
Misuse Act 1993 (“<strong>CMA</strong>”) in 2023. These offences came into
force on 8 February 2024. They target a critical component of the operation
of scam syndicates – persons in Singapore who hand over control of their
bank accounts or who disclose Singpass credentials to others, who are then
able to use these accounts and credentials to commit scams and launder
scam proceeds.</p>
<p>The Guidelines aim to provide clarity on how the new CDSA and CMA offences
should be sentenced. They include recommended starting sentences as well
as the offender- and offence-specific factors to be considered when adjusting
the starting sentence (e.g. committing the offence for personal gain, involvement
of a vulnerable victim). To send a strong deterrent signal, the Guidelines
recommend that custodial sentences should be the norm for scams-related
offences involving the handing over of bank accounts or the disclosure
of Singpass credentials. This recommendation applies to all offenders (even
young offenders below the age of 21), except juvenile offenders dealt with
in the Youth Court.</p>
