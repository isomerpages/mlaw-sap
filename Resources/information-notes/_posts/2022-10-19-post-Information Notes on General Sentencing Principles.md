The Sentencing Advisory Panel has published an Information Note on General Sentencing Principles. The note provides an overview of sentencing principles in Singapore, including the sentencing processes, the types of sentences which the courts can impose, and the principles which guide the courts in deciding on an appropriate sentence.

The Information Note on General Sentencing Principles is accessible [here](/files/TEST%20INFO%20NOTE.pdf).
